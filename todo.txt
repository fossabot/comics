- Perl; use feature qw(signatures); no warnings qw(experimental::signatures);

- rework variables available for templates: standardize names, pick decent
  names, DRY up them up, generate them in one place, document them

- twitter with @someone does not get tweeted for some reason

- backlog: list comics under series headings (hideable?)

- don't post to reddit if the link is dead

- define comic order by refering the previous or next comic, instead of
  having a date, so that inserting one for current events doesn't ripple
  through the backlog

- plugable customizable checkers and actors (reddit poster, inkscape
  importer, spell checker, frame checker, ...)

- internal archive with published dates and (source svg) file names and
  comic counts

- allow adding (invisible) watermarks;

- transcript needs to check all frames for ordering, not just rows; that
  should get rid of space padding

- comic by email: could use Sparkpost, but the list management (software)
  is probably the bigger concern, as are the privacy concerns and GDPR

- handle more frame varieties, e.g., long frame over 2 rows on the side

- add "previously published in ..." link to the bottom of the page

- comics by series pages / links

- can a comic be in more than one series? (why not?)

- prev next first last buttons per series

- spellcheck (but that's already available in Inkscape anyway)

- tags under each comics, as hyperlinks to the tag cloud

- tag cloud (see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-idioms.html#tag-clouds)
  or comics by tag pages

- export svg instead of png (for a truly fluent / responsive web design),
  but would also need to offer the font for download, I guess?
  or chop the svgs or pngs up per frame (ugly)

- minimize svg file sizes with svgo

- generate latex code for pdf

- liner notes with comments in pdf, suck in other interesting documentation

- liner notes can pull stats from comics: how long between creation and
  publication, how long was the backlog each Fri, how big was the ideas file
  each Fri, how often was the comic changed (after being published)

- sizemap should have colors depending on where the comic was published

- add a thumbnail / preview for really large images (posters), especially in
  RSS

- cleanup hard-coded names, e.g., "Rahmen" or even "Meta", "generated"

- check for date holes (why? are those bad? only in the future? but I could
  schedule a xmas or Fri 13 comic ahead of time and then have holes and
  that's ok)

- break code into different modules

- more social media: Mastodon, Openbook, Ello, Diaspora, inrupt.com
  (Zapier?)

- use a configuration file to avoid passing lots of parameters

- use inkscape shell to export in bulk (could be faster than creating
  multiple inkscape processes), would be great to avoid writing temp svg
  files if inkscape accepts the svg on stdin;
