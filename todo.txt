- rework variables available for templates: standardize names, pick decent
  names, DRY up them up, generate them in one place, document them

- backlog: list comics under series headings (hideable?)

- don't post to reddit if the link is dead

- allow specifying the subreddit(s) on a per-comic basis, plus a default
  subredditin the code

- define comic order by refering the previous or next comic, instead of
  having a date, so that inserting one for current events doesn't ripple
  through the backlog

- plugable customizable checkers and actors (reddit poster, ...)

- internal archive with published dates and (source svg) file names and
  comic counts

- transcript needs to check all frames for ordering, not just rows; that
  should get rid of space padding

- comic by email: could use Sparkpost, but the list management (software)
  is probably the bigger concern, as is the privacy concerns and GDPR

- handle more frame varieties, e.g., long frame over 2 rows on the side

- print language independent errors (e.g., frame errors) only once, not for
  each language

- add "previously published in ..." link to the bottom of the page

- comics by series pages

- can a comic be in more than one series? (why not?)

- prev next first last buttons per series

- spellcheck

- tag cloud

- tags under each comics, as hyperlinks to the tag cloud

- tag cloud (see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-idioms.html#tag-clouds)
  or comics by tag pages

- export svg instead of png (for a truly fluent / responsive web design),
  but would also need to offer the font for download, I guess?
  or chop the svgs or pngs up per frame (ugly)

- minimize svg file sizes with svgo

- generate latex code for pdf

- liner notes with comments in pdf, suck in other interesting documentation

- liner notes can pull stats from comics: how long between creation and
  publication, how long was the backlog each Fri, how big was the ideas file
  each Fri...

- sizemap should have colors depending on the comic was published

- add a thumbnail / preview for really large images (posters), especially in
  RSS

- cleanup hard-coded names, e.g., "Rahmen" or even "Meta", "generated"

- check for date holes (why? are those bad? only in the future? but I could
  schedule a xmas or Fri 13 comic ahead and then have holes and that's ok)

- break code into different modules

- toot automatically on Mastodon

- post to Google+

- use a configuration file to avoid passing lots of parameters
